# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery.

## Functionalities

1. Users should be able to enter the raffle by paying for a ticket. The ticket fees are going to be the prize the winner receives.
2. The lottery should automatically and programmatically draw a winner after a certain period. 
3. Chainlink VRF should generate a proveably random number.
4. Chainlink automation should trigger the lottery draw regularly -> Time-based triggers.
